       What is air4children ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        air4children is inspired by KHAN academy which is a non-profit
        organization with the goal of changing education for the better. In
        the same fashion, LibrE Robotics has also been thought to be a
        non-profit organization in which the main goals are fivefold:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to contribute to the development of a free world-class education
            in Robotics for anyone anywhere;
          </li>
          <li>
            to design and build low-cost robots with high standards of
            quality;
          </li>
          <li>
            to improve current open source software projects so as to be more
            approachable by inexperienced users;
          </li>
          <li>
              to design free access material in educational Robotics, and
            develop activities where organization and cooperation of the
            participants can foster possible solutions for environmental,
            social and healthcare issues; and
          </li>
          <li>
            to design and build environments where participants can discover
            and develop their own capabilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p> 
        air4children will provide software and hardware for educational robots
        that are extremely reliable (robust), modifiable, and very cheap in
        order to be accessible to anyone and to enable a much more rapid
        development of the community. In addition to that, **air4children**
        has been adopted the philosophy of free software foundation, since
        free and open-source software and hardware licences state that anyone
        is freely licensed to use, copy, study and change in any way, and the
        source code is openly shared so that users are encouraged to
        voluntarily improve the design of the software. Meyer said:
      </p>

      <p>
        Libre software offers scientists the possibility of sharing with their
        peers how they have solved problems. This, of course is basic for the
        evolution of science; but libre software goes beyond that and makes
        this happen in a cost-effective way.*
