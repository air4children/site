            <li>Computer Engineers to help us to modify Ardublock code in order to create more fancy tools to inexperienced users. They are also going to help us to proposed the computersâ€™s hardware and the process of installation. (Open source software to use: Ardublock, Apache Maven, Stable release of Debian, etc.)</li>
